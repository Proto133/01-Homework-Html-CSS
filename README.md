# 01-Homework-Html-CSS

This project is an example of refactoring existing code to improve both structure and semantic elements used -- while maintaining the manifest function and design of the original code. 

The HTML and CSS found in this repository have been edited and revised by Peter Roto in an attempt to improve Web Accessibility and ensure thos standards were being met.
